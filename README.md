# PrivacyGuard
PrivacyGuard: Intelligent Privacy Policy AuditorPrivacyGuard AI is a sophisticated browser-integrated solution designed to bridge the transparency gap between complex legal jargon and consumer data rights. By leveraging a Flask-driven Python backend and a Manifest V3 Chrome Extension, the system performs real-time linguistic auditing of privacy policies to identify high-risk data practices.The platform utilizes a weighted keyword-matching algorithm to categorize risk into three distinct tiers: Low, Moderate, and High. This allows users to instantly visualize whether a service intends to sell their personal information, track biometric data, or retain their digital footprint indefinitely.📂 Repository ArchitectureThe project is structured into a decoupled frontend-backend architecture to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance.Plaintext├── backend/

🛠️ Technical Implementation🔬 Backend Analytics (Python)The backend serves as the "brain" of PrivacyGuard AI. It exposes a RESTful API endpoint (/analyze) that accepts raw text and returns a structured JSON object containing the risk score, risk level, and a human-readable summary.Scoring Weights: Specific legal triggers like "biometric" (+30) or "sell your information" (+30) carry higher weights than generic terms like "marketing" (+10).Safety Cap: All scores are normalized to a maximum of 100/100 to ensure consistency in reporting.🌐 Frontend Extension (JavaScript/HTML)The extension handles the data ingestion and visualization layers.Extraction Engine: The content.js script waits for full page hydration before extracting document.body.innerText to ensure no dynamic content is missed.State Management: Extracted data is cached in chrome.storage.local to facilitate seamless communication between the content script, popup, and sidepanel.UI/UX: The interface uses dynamic CSS classes (e.g., .risk-high, .risk-low) to provide immediate visual feedback based on the server's response.📊 Risk Assessment MatrixThe system evaluates policies based on the following threshold logic:Score RangeRisk LevelDescription70 - 100🔴 HighSerious privacy threats: Data selling or biometric tracking detected.40 - 69🟠 ModerateConcerning practices: Data sharing with 3rd parties or tracking.0 - 39🟢 LowStandard operations: Minimal data usage beyond core services.🚀 Deployment GuidePrerequisitesPython 3.8+Flask & Flask-CORSGoogle Chrome (Developer Mode enabled)Step 1: Initialize the AI ServerBash# Clone and navigate to the backend directory
pip install flask flask-cors
python app.py
The server will initialize at http://localhost:5000.Step 2: Load the Browser InterfaceNavigate to chrome://extensions/ in your browser.Enable Developer Mode.Select Load Unpacked and upload the extension/ directory.Navigate to any privacy policy page and open the extension popup.
